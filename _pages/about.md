Welcome to my webpage.  My name is Tommaso Maria Botta and I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Mathematics department at [Columbia University](https://www.math.columbia.edu).  My mentor is [Andrei Okounkov](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~okounkov/). Previously, I was a PhD student in mathematics at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://math.ethz.ch) and my advisor was [Giovanni Felder](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~felder/).
