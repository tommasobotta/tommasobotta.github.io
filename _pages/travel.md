Most of the time I am in New York. I'll try to keep my travel plans up to date here.

0. Mar 2 - Mar 9: IPMU, Tokyo for [Enumerative geometry, representation theory, and physics](https://indico.ipmu.jp/event/427/).

0. June 2 - June 8: Northeastern University, Boston for Representation theory with an emphasis on categorification and symplectic duality.

0. July 20 - July 27: Colorado State University, Fort Collins for [2025 Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry](https://sites.google.com/view/2025summerinstitute/home).
